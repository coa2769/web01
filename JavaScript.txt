<h2>JavaScript</h2>
  <p>
  Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies
  of the World Wide Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive web pages
  and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of
   websites use it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript
  engine to execute it.
  As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven,
  functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based)
  programming styles. It has APIs for working with text, arrays, dates, regular
  expressions, and the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such
  as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment
  in which it is embedded to provide these features.
